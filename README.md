## Description

A crowd-sourced local tavern or pub review site.

The application has pages devoted to individual tavern locations where dedicated users can submit a review and rate your local pub!

This application is also powered by Open Brewery DB which is a free dataset and API with public information on breweries, cideries, brewpubs, and bottleshops.

Our application was curated for beer connoisseurs and casual beer enthusiasts alike.
